## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned:

- Centering a svg element in a div box
- overlaying color on an image
- Creating a reposive square div box

The most challenging part is the Card Image with a view-icon with color ovarlay when hovering. In the first try, I divided it into three component: a div box, an image and a svg icon, but then I found it difficult to correctly center the icon on the image.

After studying different resources on the web, I simplified it: a div box with background-image and an svg icon. To easily center the svg icon on the image, I set the position of the div box to relative and the svg icon to absolute so the svg icon is positioned relative to its parent: the div box.

The Card Image acted as the background image of the div box and so the div box needed to be responsive square to fit the image. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
